<h3 class="faq-q">{{ _("Wait... Couldn't people steal from this really easily?") }}</h3>
<div class="faq-a">
	<p>{{ _("Yes. (But please don't).") }}</p>
	<p>{{ _("The idea is to provide a convenient service to members of the UM CSE community. Betty makes a small profit off each sale, some of which will be used to cover the inevitable losses. If too many people take advantage of Betty's trusting nature, the service will have to shut down :(.") }}</p>

<h3 class="faq-q">{{ _("Tell me more about my Chez Betty account?") }}</h3>
<div class="faq-a">
	<p>{{ _("Chez Betty sells things nearly at-cost (usually about a 15% markup). "
	"Since no one likes change and Betty is a self-service operation, it's "
	"set up so that each user has an account with Betty. You can put in $20 "
	"(or however much) at a time and use that balance until it runs out.") }}</p>
</div>

<h3 class="faq-q">{{ _("What if I don't have any money / Can my account balance go negative?") }}</h3>
<div class="faq-a">
	<p>{{ _("Yes. Chez Betty allows you to spend beyond your immediate means "
	"under that assumption that you'll pay Betty back eventually. The idea "
	"is to let you grab stuff when you need it and keep track of what owe, "
	"instead of incentivizing folks to steal. There is a "
	'<a href="/shame">Wall of Shame</a> for persons who owe Betty '
	"more than $5.")|safe }}</p>

<div class="faq-a">
	<p>{{ _("Betty sells things just above wholesale, usually a 15% markup. "

<div class="faq-a">
	<p>{{ _("First, Betty has to pay her debts (e.g. any losses incurred from "
	"dishonest Chez Betty users). After that, Betty's profits roll into the "
	"CSEG general fund. They're used to fund improvements to Betty, buy "
	"miscellaneous needs (e.g. new ping pong paddles and balls), or to throw "
	"events (e.g. bar nights) for CSEG.") }}</p>
