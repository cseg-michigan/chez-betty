<p>Hi {{ user.name }},</p>

<p>If you haven't heard, Chez Betty is back! Yes it took a while,
but we are excited to finally have the food co-op open again.</p>

<p>We did want to let you know that your current balance is
<span style="color:red;">{{ user.balance|format_currency|safe }}</span>.
Please settle that up so that Betty can restock and continue to be available
to people on North Campus.
