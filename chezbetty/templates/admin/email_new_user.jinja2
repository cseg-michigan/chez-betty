<p>Hi {{ user.name }},</p>

<p>Welcome to Chez Betty!</p>

<p>
Betty is a food co-op for the CSE community.
Betty runs on the honor system and works like a debit account: you put some
money in your account and use it to buy items. Betty will keep track of how
much money you have left in your account.
</p>

<p>
If you run out of money in your account, Betty will extend some credit to you.
We do ask that you try to keep a positive balance so that we can afford to
keep things in stock. Also, Betty gives a 5% discount to users with over $20
in their account.
</p>

<p>
You can see your transaction history or deposit money into your account using
a credit card on your <a href="https://chezbetty.store/user">user page</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions or issues, you can e-mail the administrators at
<a href="mailto:chezbetty@umich.edu">chezbetty@umich.edu</a>.
</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy Betty!</p>

<br />
<p>- Chez Betty</p>
