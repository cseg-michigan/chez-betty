History of Chez Betty
=====================

- January 3, 2017: Added new shelves. Both for drink storage and for
more food display.
- June 16, 2016: Tried to hire a moving company to pick up our
Costco order, and have Costco put our order on pallets. We did get the
food, but it was a bit of an ordeal.
- June 9, 2016: Added a 42"x18"x54" inch shelf to betty to hold bins
full of chips and other bagged food.
- May 14, 2016: Added a bill acceptor to Betty. This should prevent
most of the loss from cash deposits being entered but the money
not being in the cash box.
- May 14, 2016: Replaced the thermostat in the True GDM-72 refrigerator.
The old one failed, causing the fridge to get too warm, then failed
the other way causing a lot of drinks to freeze. All told, it cost
Betty about $250.
- Dec 9, 2015: Betty ditches the BeagleBone Black and moves to an Intel
Nuc. Hopefully that will be more reliable and responsive.
- Sep 20, 2015: Betty restocks start requiring renting a U-Haul. With purchases at
Costco over $6k, this is the only way to move that much inventory.
- May 20, 2015: Betty bought the triple-wide fridge for $1200. Took 6 or so people
to get it into 2909, but actually cold drinks made it worth it.
- March 2015: Betty bought a freezer. After placing an ice cream order
with the Nestle rep at Kroger, Betty needed more space for frozen items.
Even with the expanded capacity, ice cream remains one of the fastest
sellers.
- July 10, 2014: One of the coolers from the Foo Bar is brought up to the
grad lounge and becomes cold storage for Chez Betty drinks.
- July 8, 2014: Chez Betty is installed in 2817 BBB. After a Costco run, adding
the first batch of items, stocking the shelves, and getting Internet to
the touchscreen and Beagle Bone Black, Betty is alive at 11 PM.
- June 27-29, 2014: 4901 BBB becomes the Chez Betty development office.
- June 20, 2014: Zakir and Brad buy all of the hardware that will become Betty.
- May 2014: After months of procrastination, Brad, Zakir, and Pat decided to set
aside a weekend and build Chez Betty. Pat creates an account with ITS for LDAP
access, but nothing else happens for a while.
- Summer 2013: A video chat with Tristan Halvorson at UCSD reveals that Chez
Betty is definitely worth doing. However, it is clear we are going to have to
build our own system.
- Summer 2013: Brad Campbell, Meghan Clark, Zakir Durumeric, Pat Pannuto decide
"Hey, if UCSD has Chez Bob, we should have Chez Betty."
